<p>
<a href="../wiki/Main/ProofGeneralEclipse">Proof General Eclipse</a> is an application
based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse IDE</a>
which supports interactive theorem provers.
<br/>
At the moment it only supports recent
<a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel">development snapshots
of Isabelle</a> (dated close to the product you download),
or the current CVS version.  For best results we recommend building
Isabelle with PolyML 5.0.
<br/>
See the <a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/Main/PGEclipseInstall">wiki</a> 
for full installation instructions.  Please
note that this is an early beta prototype and <b>not yet recommended for
real use</b>.    There are issues documented 
<a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/Main/PGEclipseFixesNeeded">here</a>
which we are working to fix.
If you're undeterred, please fill the 
<a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/register">registration form</a>
so we can get an idea of interest.

Please help us improve Proof General!  You can suggest ideas 
and contribute documentation and discussion 
on the <a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/TWiki/TWikiRegistration">wiki</a>

<p>
Proof General Eclipse is part of the
<a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/kit">Proof General Kit</a> project
which is providing a suite of tools and
novel techniques to support
proof development, replacing the
current <a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk">Emacs-based Proof General</a>.

<h3>
PGEclipse standalone Eclipse product (recommended)
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
See: <a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/eclipse/products" target="_top">
     http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/eclipse/products</a>
</li></ul> 

<p>
Download and unpack the zip file for your architecture. The executable
is called <code>PGEclipse</code>.  It requires JRE 5.0.  
To get the latest updates (or <em>in progress</em> plugins for
other provers), go
to <em>Help -&gt; Software Updates -&gt; Find and Install</em>.
</p>


<h3>
Update Site: Proof General Plugin Feature
</h3>

<p>
To add Proof General as an installation site to your running
Eclipse platform: 
</p>

<ol>
<li> Select in the menu <em>Help -&gt; Software Updates -&gt; Find and Install</em></li>
<li> Select "search for new features to install" and click Next</li>
<li> Click on "New Remote Site" and add the update site for Proof General:<br/>
<blockquote>
Name: <code>Proof General Eclipse</code><br/>
URL:  <code>http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/eclipse</code>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li> Then enable the new site, and install the Proof General Eclipse feature you are offered and follow the instructions.</li>
</ol> 

<p>
After this you will have Proof General available in your Eclipse install.
You will be able to update it via the same menu, or disable or uninstall it
via <em>Help -&gt; Software Updates -&gt; Manage configuration</em>.
</p>

<p>
We do not recommend extending your own Eclipse installation as it is
more likely to throw up compatibility problems which we cannot test
for.  Using our standalone product is simpler.  Nonetheless, please
report any problems you have if you follow this route.
