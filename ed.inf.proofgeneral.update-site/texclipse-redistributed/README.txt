We're re-distributing a compiled version of Texclipse on this update site.

There is no change to the source code, but the feature and plugin products have
had a date stamp.

The sources are available from source forge, to rebuild you need to checkout
the projects from CVS.

The enclosed patches can be applied to the projects to fix the version
numbers for our update site.
