        ProofGeneral is a front-end to a number of theorem-proving systems. 
        This is the Eclipse version of ProofGeneral, a re-implementation
        of the old Emacs version, for the modern Java-based IDE
        (that's an Integrated Development Environment).

        To get started, you should create a new simple project
        (from the File -> New menu), and link in external files or
        folders (again from File -> New once your new project is
        highlighted; make sure to select "Advanced" and "Link",
        otherwise you will be editting a copy of your files!).

        You can double click the tab for this window to
        see the rest of the views Eclipse Proof General provides.
        The "Outline" view next to the Navigator is particularly
        useful if you're working in a large file -- you may want
        to drag it and move it.
        Oh, and of course you can close this window when you're done with it.
