<!-- Isar's new display drafts command.  Maybe this could be made
     into a PGIP command for printing?  [But in general we would expect
     the interface to be capable of this: it is simply a bad failing of 
     X Symbol at present]

     FIXME: at present the output from LaTeX subprocess does not
     get passed through print mode machinery.
