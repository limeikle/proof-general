<body>This package contains classes used to perform "shallow" or "light" parsing. 
Shallow parsing (which is perhaps more akin to lexing) 
detects comment blocks, proof-text blocks and keywords.
It is used by the PGSourceViewerConfiguration to provide syntax highlighting.

Note: The PartitionScanner has hard-coded recognition of Isabelle comments.
