<h1>Proof General Help Links</h1>

<p>
Help and documentation for Proof General are provided via the project wiki.
This is located at: <a href="http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/Main/ProofGeneralEclipse">
http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/wiki/Main/ProofGeneralEclipse</a>.
</p>

<p>
We have adopted a demand-driven wiki-based approach to documentation 
(mainly because staff time is in very short supply). Documentation will mainly 
be written in response to questions posted on the wiki. If you want to know 
something, edit the appropriate page (click on the 'edit page' link) and add your 
question. Anyone who knows the answer can then fill it in. This will typically be 
the developers, but users can also help. You can use the automatic notification
options in the wiki to be notified by email when the topic has been
updated.

<p>
Help for Eclipse related issues - that is, how to use the Eclipse IDE
 - is provided by the Workbench User Guide in the Help Browser. This is accessed via 
 Help-&gt;Help Contents
