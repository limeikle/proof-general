<intro>Welcome to the Proof General Eclipse IDE!  Here are some pointers for getting started.
</intro>

<item><b>Eclipse</b>
<p>First, you should get to know Eclipse. 
Please read the Eclipse workbench help. 

You can find this under 
Help-&gt;Help Contents-&gt;
<topic id="/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/toc.xml">Workbench User Guide</topic>.

To use Emacs key bindings, go to Window -> Preferences -> [type filter text: "keys"]
and change the scheme from Default to Emacs.
</p>
</item>

<item><b>Proof General</b>
<p>To get started, you should create a project for your work with 
File->New->...->Proof Project. 

Create proof scripts within
the project using File->New->Proof Script.

Further help and documentation for Proof General is provided on the PG Wiki.

<topic id="/ed.inf.proofgeneral/help/toc.xml">Click here for links to the PG Wiki</topic>.

<!-- da: let's remove this for now, it's just annoying to be directed
  to something that's broken and of debatable quality anyway.
<item><b>Isabelle</b>
<p>We have a brief, prototype tutorial  
written with the Proof General Eclipse editor in mind. This is part of the PG Wiki, 
but you can access it via the <i>PG Teacher View</i>. 
You can open this view from the menu bar using
Window->Show View->(Other->Proof General)->PG Teacher View.

<item><b>Handy features</b>
<p>Some handy features of Proof General Eclipse you may like to try are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Outline View</i>.  Once the file is parsed, shows the structure of
the file and highlights incomplete proofs.
</li>
<li><i>Content Assist</i>. Suggests keywords, theorem names, etc with popup information<br/>
Use Edit->Content Assist.
</li>
<!-- same comment as above applies to these:
Locating definitions button [FIXME: think we can get this working, just shouldn't be bookmarks]
<li><i>Proof Object List</i>. Provides a pick list for keywords, theorem names, etc.<br/>
Use Window->Show View->Proof Object List.
</li>

</ul>
