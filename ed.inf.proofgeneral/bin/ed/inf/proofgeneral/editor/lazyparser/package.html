This package contains classes used to perform "deep" parsing, 
also called lazy-parsing because it is only performed when requested 
(as opposed to light-parsing, which is performed as the user types). 

Deep parsing detects proof-commands and document structure. 
It is used by the indexing and outline features, and the script-management actions.
