I created with the extension point wizard 5.12.06.
Nothing more done, yet but some future(!) ideas are:

 - Proof builder automatically processes files using the
 batch mode on the prover (PGIP <loadfile> command)
 
 - It finds out dependencies for files somehow 
 (potentially by parsing every file to get a first metainfo
 element which indicates file dependencies: although parsing
 every file could be expensive and we definitely want
 to cache parses).

A useful first step would be to implement parsing automatically,
at least.  Proof is directed interactively at present, we should
keep it that way until the Broker is integrated here.
