Things to do in session manager [da]:

1. Split up main class to remove ScriptManager and ProverCommandQueue

2. Rationalise/document event processing!  At the moment it seems quite
   complicated for the behaviour needed.  Rather than inventing general
   events we could be more specific to purpose.  The command queue can
   be made with call backs to take the action required when a command
   completes.  That may then involve sending events elsewhere, but
   hopefully less roundabouts to ourself.

3. Implement document-based do and undo, without using a command history.
   The document *is* the history for us.
