Files were made with Omnigraffle/gimp/png2ico.
Star icon based on Daniel's star16.gif graphic.

Windows ico file notes:
- png2ico seems to reduce colour space always
- Imagemagick has no way of making 32 bit depth bmp
- GD: Fixed using Windows tools.

Question: can the branding icons be omitted from the binary distribution?
