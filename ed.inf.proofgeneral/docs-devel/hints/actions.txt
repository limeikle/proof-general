Actions in Proof General Eclipse
[David Aspinall, July 2007]

I have simplified the handling of actions:

1. The main actions are now retargetable, which means that they can be switched to track
the active editor.  This happens in  ProofScriptEditorActionContributor.  Retargetable
actions are created in ProofScriptEditor and do not have a class attribute
in the plugin.xml, unlike global actions.  This is the standard Eclipse mechanism
and removes old code which attempted to track the active editor.

2. The previous intricate locking mechanism has been simplified to the following strategy:

  (i)   Synchronize on the action object (preventing active editor switching)
  (ii)  Execute the action immediately; queue up the commands; or schedule another thread (least preferred)
  (iii) Exit swiftly

  Executing the action in another thread may lose if something else gets scheduled in between;
  the other thread should check that the action still makes sense.
