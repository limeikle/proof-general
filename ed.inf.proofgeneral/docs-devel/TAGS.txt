The following tags are used in the sources:

TODO
FIXME

[PROVERNAME] SPECIFIC:  a piece of code specific for some prover
                        ideally should be removed and somehow merged into
                        PGIP.


NB: You can configure the task list search for tags in the
Preferences -> Java Compiler -> Task Tags
