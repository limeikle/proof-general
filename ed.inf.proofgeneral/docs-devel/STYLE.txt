Some notes on recommended programming style for Proof General
-------------------------------------------------------------

These are some notes on recommendations that should be followed in the code, but
aren't at the moment.  - DA.

* Keep exceptions for exceptional circumstances. E.g. do not program
  method invocation on an object that may be null and protect with
  an exception handler.  Instead use an explicit null test.

* Follow good coding conventions for Java, e.g. always surround statements
  in loops and conditionals by braces, do not use multiple variable
  declarations/initialisations, use Java syntax for arrays.  You can
  test for these with the analysis tools of TPTP.

* Use standard headers on all files (TODO: we should add license details
  to each file).
