 Eclipse Proof General -- Old Bug List

This is a list of old bugs.  Some of these may still apply and should
be added as tickets to trac: proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac.


OLD BUGS STILL NOTED:

- error messages about accessing context/help file if installed as root and
  run as me (config/prefHelpContext.xml should be in user's dir, not global config)
- cancelling restart logic locks that command
- null pointer errors in decideEnabled on prover shutdown
- colours for locked text don't change until Eclipse is restarted

- stream gobbler should implement more sophisticated thread that can tell if commands are waiting and how many
  (would cut down unnec "avail" checks)
- queue might get hung if cmd proc doesn't fire, or is handled by private listener (see _ON_READY in SessionManager)
- note (somewhere) the requirement every command sent to prover generates Error or CmdProc, before sending Ready;
  really the requirement is that all events sent to prover generate a Ready message, and the SM
  *always* sends CmdSuccess or CmdCausedErrorEvent as appropriate, then *always* sends a CmdProc message; then Ready;
  events not sent to prover should always generate a CmdCausedError.CmdCancelled event then CmdProc.
- haven't tested sockets at all (probably has errors)
- PGAction (as Delegate) can only get link to real IAction class after first run(IAction), so tool buttons don't show inactive until first click
- possible (though rare, because waits on prover) that next tries to fire (or undo)
  before undo updates essential lock/parse offset, undo should also wait on display thread;
  would cause a severe error
- we could queue "next" commands to be sent multiply (queue parsing as well) as soon as doc is updated,
  maybe even showing number in next bracket
- thread pool can get null (doesn't seem to affect processing)
- multiple errors generate multiple dialogs (eg lock a region and try typing... this shouldn't even display an error probably)
- autoscroll on "next" should be a preference
- scrolling shouldn't move if offset is visible
- comment-stepping -- should be a preference
  TODO needs search for all instances of PGIPSyntax.COMMAND; also see ProofGeneralPlugin.SEND_STEP_COMMENT???
- would like cancel option when closing an active script (see in ProofScriptEditor.dispose())
