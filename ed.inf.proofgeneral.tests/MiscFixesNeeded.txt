Some notes about miscellaneous fixes needed, without test cases.

6.12.06 [da]
============

* Quick diff reference provider for decoding symbols: should recode symbols
  only for proof script documents (comments added at top).
  
* Many assertions triggered re. JFace.  Should investigate/fix these if
  they're our fault.
