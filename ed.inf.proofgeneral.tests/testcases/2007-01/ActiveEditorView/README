[da] Something that was confusing me for a while:

The "active" editor may be different from the displayed editor,
when the Navigator is used to switch between editors.

This can mean that the toolbar buttons take action in another
editor, which can be quite confusing.  There may also be underlying
bugs, I'm not sure.  

Test case:

 1. Open NewTheory1.thy and NewTheory2.thy
 2. Click on activate button for NewTheory2.thy, making it active
 3. Click on NewTheory2.thy in Navigator: it is displayed, but not set
    as active (maybe because editor is not active).
 4. Click on Next button in toolbar (or menu), repeatedly
 
 Then (reasonably enough) NewTheory2 gets processed.  It's confusing
 that it's invisible, though.  We might consider to make the 
 PGProverAction raise the active window, although if the action is
 called from a program that's not so great.
 
 Let's leave as is for now.
