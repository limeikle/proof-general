da: interrupting Isabelle causes system exit.

Process Tarski.thy and hit interrupt button.

Problems:

 1) System should not exit
 2) When system exits, state should be cleaned up.
    Especially prover ownership!!
    
Status:

 2) partially solved: prover ownership is reset on
 restarting session.  However, active script dialog
 kicks in during closing editor that has partly-processed
 script: more state should be cleared on prover exit
 and active scripting switch shouldn't assume prover is active.
