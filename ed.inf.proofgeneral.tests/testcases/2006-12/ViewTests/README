Some test cases to fix some odd behaviours interacting with views:

 1. switching to prover output view after startup shows initial messages, not latest
 Since we have some enormous log of messages somewhere (session log), we should be
 able to retrieve the latest output, shouldn't we?
 (LOW PRIORITY: DEFER).
 
 2. error during processing loses active editor making some other window active
