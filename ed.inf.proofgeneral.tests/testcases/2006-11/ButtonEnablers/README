STATUS:			unresolved

DESCRIPTION:

  Action buttons on toolbar not enabled and disabled appropriately.
  Disabling often only occurs after a button action returns an exception.
  Enabling often occurs only after restarting the prover, and not appropriately.

TEST CASE:


 
FURTHER INFORMATION:

  Button state is determined in:
  -- PGAction
     |-- PGProverAction
         |-- [type]Action (e.g. UndoAction)
   
  When are buttons enabled/disabled?

FIX NEEDED:

  * Simplest solution is to leave all buttons permenantly enabled, and to signal
	a warning when a 'disabled' action is used.
	
	STATUS: this is mostly complete, but needs more thorough testing.
	
  * More complete solution is for buttons to be individually aware of when it is
	appropriate to be run.
  * Realistically these checks may require to be carried out in a background 
	thread (with priority given to disabled buttons), and a combination of the 
	two solutions would be best, where a button is enabled in any doubt.
