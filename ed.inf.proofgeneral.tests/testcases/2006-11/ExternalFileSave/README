STATUS:			unresolved

DESCRIPTION:

 Saving an external file fails to write anything to file.
 "Save As" performs similarly, but it also removes the editor and its changes.
 Eclipse believes the file has been writen, and resets its 'dirty' status.

TEST CASE:

 Start a new Proof General session.
 Open a .thy file from the file system using File... Open
 This file can be in any location, except within an active project.
 Make a change to the file (eclipse will flag the change with a '*' in its tab)
 EITHER
	 Choose save, close the file and reopen it
	 ( You will find its contents unchanged )
 OR
 	Choose save as and pick a new file name.
 	( You will find the editor closes, and cannot reopen the "new" file )
 
FURTHER INFORMATION:

 Seems to be caused by the fact that files external to the project are provided to the
 ProofScriptEditor by a "JavaFileEditorInput" instance.
 
 This seems to be a general problem with the Eclipse framework: you can crash the
 standard installation very easily by opening an external text file and using 
 "Save As" (as of 3.2.1).
 
FIX NEEDED:

Possible fixes
 * Ensure that files are loaded in the same way regardless of their internal/external status
 * Prevent loading of external files (use 'open' as a shortcut to 'import')
 
 * DA: probably nothing for now.  I added a contentType in the hope this might
 influence the choice of JavaFileEditorInput but it doesn't seem to help.
