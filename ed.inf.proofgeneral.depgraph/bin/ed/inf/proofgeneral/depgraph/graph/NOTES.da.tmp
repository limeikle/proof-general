This has several things in plugin.xml:

 editor contribution: edits multi-page editors with extn .graph
   (perhaps because she couldn't get ordinary view working?)
 popup menu contribution extension
 toolbar action
 
 two packages:
 
  ed.inf.proofgeneral.popup.actions
  ed.inf.proofgeneral.dependencygraph
  
 What needs doing:
 
  - getting it working!!!
  - testing, improving the code  (Elina's report claimed to have a test package)
